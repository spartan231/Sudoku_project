Provided for students
Given a number of rows and number of cells to remove, this function:
1. creates a SudokuGenerator
2. fills its values and saves this as the solved state
3. removes the appropriate number of cells
4. returns the representative 2D Python Lists of the board and solution

Parameters:
size is the number of rows/columns of the board (9 for this project)
removed is the number of cells to clear (set to 0)

Return: list[list] (a 2D Python list to represent the board)
